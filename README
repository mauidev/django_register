Django REST demo using Angular JS
==============================================================================

This sample project provides a crud application, the registration of users, as an
example of how a rest api and an angular js client work together.

Instead of a pure SPA client app, the register.html page is tokenized by the django
template engine before rendering on the browser. All interactions are then done using
ajax requests using the Angular's $http service.

The goal of this approach is to show what a hybrid design would look like and provides
an alternative to everything being done on the client side, ie, first show the page
by having the server generate it.



Dependencies
==============================================================================
This demo project was developed using the following versions:

django 1.5.2
python 2.7.5

It's suggested that you install django in a virtualenv environment.


How to start the application
==============================================================================

Starting from the root project directory:

cd register
manage.py runserver

Point browser to localhost:8000/demo/login.
